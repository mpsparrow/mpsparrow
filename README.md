### Hello ðŸ‘‹ I see you found my profile ðŸ‘€

Here you will find a pile of random, half-finished, and badly documented projects. My specialty is Python with some PHP and JS mixed in. I mainly code website related applications and bots. I used to be heavily involved in the WordPress community but ended up taking a step back to focus on my schooling and Computer Engineering degree.

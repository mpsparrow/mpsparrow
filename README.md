#### Just a Computer Engineering student messing about... 

I used to be heavily involved in WordPress; developing plugins and volunteering with WordPress Support. Web design and hosting side-business since 2016.

Often default to Python for projects. Spent lots of time with PHP, JS, and HTML/CSS in web related projects. Dabbled varying amounts in Go, Java, TypeScript, and C/C++. Often use: Flask, Matplotlib, Tkinter, React, Bootstrap, Docker, Ubuntu, Nginx, WordPress, PostgreSQL, MySQL.
